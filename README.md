Week 4: File Handling and Exception Handling

# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è & Error Handling Lab üß™

## Overview
This project provides two Python programs:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**: Reads the content of a file, modifies it, and writes the result to a new file.
2. **Error Handling Lab**: Handles file-related errors gracefully when attempting to read a file based on user input.

## How to Use

### File Read & Write Challenge

This program reads content from an input file, transforms the text (e.g., converting it to uppercase), and writes the modified content to an output file.

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Provide input and output filenames
input_file = "example.txt"
output_file = "modified_example.txt"

# Run the function to modify and write the file content
read_and_write(input_file, output_file)
```

**Output**:
- If `example.txt` exists, its content is converted to uppercase and saved in `modified_example.txt`.
- If an error occurs (e.g., the file doesn't exist), the program handles it and displays an appropriate error message.

### Error Handling Lab

This program asks the user for a filename, attempts to read it, and handles errors like non-existent files or permission issues.

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Run the function to handle file reading with error handling
error_handling_lab()
```

**Output**:
- If the file exists, its content is displayed.
- If the file does not exist, an error message is shown: `Error: The file 'filename' does not exist.`
- If permission is denied, an appropriate error is shown: `Error: Permission denied for file 'filename'.`

## Code Explanation

### File Read & Write Challenge
- The program uses the `with` statement to handle file opening and closing automatically.
- The `try-except` block handles potential errors like `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`.

### Error Handling Lab
- Uses `input()` to prompt the user for a filename.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and `IOError` for a robust user experience.
